Ozil's Eye Soccer Game

This was a basic soccer game I implemented in Python using MVC framework and the module PyGame. I incorporated a few basic AI moves and also some additional features like player switching that is essential to games with multiple controllable elements.

###Command

```python Ozil's Eye.py```
